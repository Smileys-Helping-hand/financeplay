# 🔄 Account-Linked Transactions Feature

## How It Works

### Adding a Transaction
1. Go to **Transactions** page
2. Click **"Add Transaction"**
3. Fill in the transaction details
4. **Select an account** from the dropdown (optional but recommended)
5. See a **live preview** of how the transaction will affect the account
6. Click **"Add Transaction"**

### Automatic Balance Updates

#### For Expenses (food, transport, rent, etc.)
- Amount is **deducted** from the selected account
- Example: Buy groceries for R150 from "Main Wallet"
  - Main Wallet: R1000 → R850 ✅

#### For Income
- Amount is **added** to the selected account
- Example: Receive salary R5000 to "Bank Account"
  - Bank Account: R2000 → R7000 ✅

### Deleting Transactions
- When you delete a transaction, the account balance is **automatically restored**
- The system reverses the transaction:
  - Deleted expense → money added back
  - Deleted income → money removed

### Transaction Display
- Each transaction shows which account it's linked to
- Format: `Category • Date • Account Name`
- Account names are highlighted in blue/primary color

## Benefits

✅ **Automatic Balance Tracking** - No manual calculations needed  
✅ **Account Visibility** - See which account each transaction used  
✅ **Accurate Records** - Balance updates happen instantly  
✅ **Easy Reversals** - Deleting a transaction fixes the balance automatically  
✅ **Multi-Account Support** - Track spending across wallets, banks, savings  

## Example Workflow

1. **Setup**: Add accounts (Wallet, Bank, Savings)
2. **Track**: Add transactions and link them to accounts
3. **Monitor**: Watch your account balances update in real-time
4. **Review**: Go to Accounts page to see total balance across all accounts

## Tips

💡 Always link transactions to accounts for better tracking  
💡 Use different accounts for different purposes (daily spending vs savings)  
💡 Check the preview before submitting to avoid mistakes  
💡 If you don't select an account, the transaction is still recorded but won't affect any balance
